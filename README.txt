Welcome to the repository for Study Buddy! Study Buddy
is a web and Android application designed to help
students find and organize study sessions to help them
do better in class.

The folder "Web App" contains all of the code for the
web side of Study Buddy, while "Android App" contains
all of the code for the Study Buddy Android application.

There are READMEs in each of those folders with more 
details about each side of the project.
